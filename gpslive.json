REST APIs are a powerful way to integrate your internal software systems with GPSLive. \n\t\tYou can query information about; vehicle locations, alerts & notifications, drivers, places, trip log and history in an automated fashion.<br><br>\n\t\tGPSLive has an integrated Application Programming Interface (API) that functions as a web service for \n\t\tenabling our customers and third-party developers to efficiently get information on their objects such as; \n\t\treal-time location, object messages, and diagnostic data in JSON format. If you miss functionality in our APIs, \n\t\tcontact us to let us know what you are missing and why you need it, so we can start working on developing an endpoint.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\tTo start testing the APIs, Click authorize and enter your API token, API token can be found on GPSLive software by navigating to the page -> Settings -> API.\n\t\t<br><br>When using the API, please make sure to send the date & time as follows: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss\".<br><br>\n\t\tAll date & time requests and responses are in UTC time zone.\n\t\t",
